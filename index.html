    <h3>Fun Facts About Blobby</h3>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Blobfish are native to the the waters off Australia and
       New Zealand, where they bob along the sea floor, scooping
       up any unsuspecting small creatures that cross their path.
      They live at average depths of 3,000 feet.</p>

      <p>Their diet consists of small crustaceans like crabs,
        sea urchins, and shellfish. These goodies are sucked into
        the blobfish’s mouth as it floats along.  Lacking both
         bones and teeth, they do not actively hunt. In fact,
         their extremely low muscle mass doesn’t allow for much
         movement at all. Besides eating, conserving energy is the
          blobfish’s main job.</p>
